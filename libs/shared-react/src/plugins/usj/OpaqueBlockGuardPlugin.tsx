/**
 * Refuses an edit aimed INSIDE a construct the editor carries opaquely — an `UnknownNode` (figure,
 * sidebar, `\periph`, `\ref`, `\optbreak`) or a table — so a read-only block is genuinely read-only
 * rather than destructive on contact.
 *
 * Without this, a keystroke reaching such a block does not fail to apply; it applies CATASTROPHICALLY.
 * The adaptor renders an opaque block's content children in Lexical's TOKEN mode so the block reads
 * and navigates as one unit, and inserting into a token node REPLACES THE WHOLE NODE — one typed
 * character turns a figure's `My caption` into `Z`, taking the rest of the caption with it. Silently
 * accepting a keystroke and losing neighbouring content to it is the failure the no-silent-no-ops
 * rule exists to prevent; a refused keystroke, where the character simply never appears, is not.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately narrow: an edit is refused when an END of the selection lands INSIDE an
 * opaque construct. That covers a caret sitting in one, and a selection reaching in from the text
 * outside and stopping partway through — the shape that guts the construct's engine-owned bytes (a
 * row's `\tr ` glyph and its separator) while leaving the construct itself in the document. Nothing
 * repairs that afterwards: `$settleScopeForNode` returns undefined inside an opaque construct, so no
 * re-tokenization ever reconciles the screen with the file again.
 *
 * A selection that CONTAINS a construct whole — both ends outside it — is deliberately still not
 * this guard's business. That is a request to replace a region of the document, which is the
 * structural-deletion question and is answered elsewhere; annexing it here would turn a targeted
 * guard into a blanket one.
 *
 * Navigation and copying stay untouched, because they are what a read-only block is FOR: the block's
 * bytes are selectable and copyable. Only keys that would insert or delete are refused, and
 * modifier chords (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, the marker engine's Ctrl+Space) are never treated as text.
 * Dragging OUT of a block is likewise left alone so drag-to-copy keeps working; the destructive
 * clipboard directions (cut, and a drop landing inside) are refused by their own commands.
 *
 * The delete COMMANDS are guarded alongside `KEY_DOWN` rather than left to it, because a delete
 * chord never reaches the key filter as typing: Lexical routes Ctrl/Alt+Backspace straight to
 * `DELETE_WORD_COMMAND` and Cmd/Ctrl+Backspace to `DELETE_LINE_COMMAND`, and the filter must keep
 * treating a modifier chord as a command so Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Space still work. Guarding the delete
 * commands themselves closes that without reopening the chords.
 *
 * Mount alongside the other guards. Read-only is not a view mode — a construct the editor cannot
 * model is opaque in every marker mode — so this plugin takes no `viewOptions` and is never gated
 * on one.

 *
 * Two kinds of typing do not announce themselves as a single character and so are decided before
 * that rule:
 *
 * - An IME composition keystroke inserts CJK/complex-script text but arrives as `key === "Process"`
 *   (`keyCode === 229` is the DOM's legacy "handled by IME" signal, needed because some engines
 *   fire the first composition keydown before `isComposing` flips true).
 * - AltGr sets BOTH `ctrlKey` and `altKey` on Windows and Linux, yet it types — AltGr+Q is `@` on a
 *   German keyboard. `getModifierState("AltGraph")` is what tells it apart from a real Ctrl+Alt
 *   chord, so Ctrl+Alt shortcuts keep reaching their handlers.
 *
 * Exported because it defines what "typing" means for the read-only guard, and that definition is
 * worth pinning directly rather than only through the plugin's command wiring.
