/**
 * The transient caret-host lifecycle, shared by every guard that needs one.
 *
 * Some caret positions in this editor can only be expressed as an ELEMENT point — a boundary with
 * no text node on it — because what surrounds them renders no text the browser can draw an
 * insertion point in: a childless decorator such as an immutable verse number, or a collapsed note
 * whose content is hidden. Lexical is perfectly happy with such a caret; the browser paints
 * nothing, so the user sees no cursor and the next keypress becomes the page's rather than the
 * editor's. The repair is to materialize a zero-width-space text node at that position and move the
 * caret into it.
 *
 * The repair is stated once, as "put the caret at the boundary past this node, and give that
 * boundary something to render the caret in if nothing there already does". Stating it that way
 * lets a guard drive it from an arrival the caret's own resting place cannot express — a click that
 * came down inside hidden content, or produced no caret at all — and get the same position and the
 * same single host as the arrival that does announce itself.
 *
 * The host is TRANSIENT, and this hook is what makes that true in one place rather than once per
 * guard: it is created only when the caret comes to rest at such a position, removed as soon as the
 * caret leaves or the editor blurs, and stripped the moment real text is typed into it. It never
 * accumulates and never appears in a document nobody put a caret into.
 *
 * Every mutation carries {@link CURSOR_CHANGE_TAG}, which is in `blackListedChangeTags` — so the
 * commit never reaches the host application's USJ-change handler and produces no delta op. The USJ
 * serializer drops a placeholder-only text node as well, and the collab coordinate systems give it
 * zero length, so a host cannot reach saved Scripture or a peer even if one somehow outlived a
 * commit. All placeholder handling is scoped to the tracked host by node key — a zero-width space
 * is legitimate content in some scripts (Thai/Khmer/Lao line breaks) and is never touched.
 *
 * Unlike the arrow-driven `CursorHandler` placeholder system (perf-react), this hosts a *resting*
 * caret.
 *
 * @param $caretHostAnchor - The guard's own rule for when a host is needed. Must be stable across
 *   renders (declare it at module scope), since it is an effect dependency.
 * @returns The repair step itself, for a guard that has an arrival of its own to drive it from.
