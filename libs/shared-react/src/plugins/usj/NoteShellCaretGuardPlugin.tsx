/**
 * Keeps the caret out of an expanded note's shell — the opening glyph and caller a host governs
 * through its own UI rather than as text (`ViewOptions.isNoteShellEditable: false`; Paratext 10's
 * footnote editor has a dropdown for each, as does Paratext 9).
 *
 * Rendering those nodes in Lexical's `token` mode is what makes them atomic to the operations that
 * ASK a node whether it can be split, but it does not keep a caret from landing among their
 * characters, and a caret that does land there is not inert: an insertion with the caret strictly
 * inside a token node replaces the WHOLE node with the typed character. The measured results are a
 * caller replaced by the keystroke — which then leaks into the note's content on save — and, for
 * the opening glyph, a note destroyed outright, since a note that has lost its opener is unwrapped
 * as deletion damage. Both read on screen as an edit that was accepted and then quietly reverted.
 *
 * So the caret is corrected the moment it comes to rest there, in the same update, before anything
 * can be typed. It lands at the start of the note's content — where the note IS editable, and where
 * a `\cat` category run belongs. The one exception is a KEYBOARD move coming back out of that
 * content: that one lands before the whole note, so the shell is crossed in a single hop rather
 * than trapping the caret against it.
 *
 * A pointer is held to a destination, never a direction. It is read from the pointer being DOWN
 * when the selection lands, which is the order a click delivers (`pointerdown`, then the selection
 * change, then `pointerup`) — the click event itself arrives too late to answer in the same update,
 * and correcting twice would let other selection listeners see the wrong position in between.
 *
 * Not gated on view options: the rule reads the shell's own node mode, so it is structurally a
 * no-op in the views that build an editable shell (the main editor's Markers view expands notes
 * precisely so the whole note can be edited as text).
 *
 * @returns Always `null`; this plugin renders no UI.
