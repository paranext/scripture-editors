 * in the gutter is an aid to reading, so it is never a caret position, while a marker rendered as
 * editable text in the flow IS content the user clicks into on purpose. A document can carry both
 * at once, so the two questions this asks — "did the click land on a gutter marker?" and "does the
 * prefix at this paragraph's start host a caret at all?" — are asked of the nodes in the tree.
 *
 * Using `CLICK_COMMAND` instead of `registerUpdateListener` + `editor.update` ensures the
 * correction is committed in a single cycle — other listeners (e.g. `OnSelectionChangePlugin`)
 * see only the corrected cursor, never the intermediate prefix position.

 * Corrects the cursor when it lands at the very start of a paragraph, before a structural prefix

 * hanging-indent gutter of any marker that sets a negative `text-indent` (e.g. `\li`, `\li1`,
 * `\li2`, `\ili`, `\ili1`, `\ili2`, and poetry markers), which resolves to an element-typed anchor

 *

 * verse nodes) to the first content `TextNode`, or to the element offset just after all those
 * structural nodes when no content `TextNode` follows yet.
 *
 * An EDITABLE marker glyph (`MarkerNode`, markerMode "editable") is deliberately not corrected: it
 * is a `TextNode`, so it hosts a caret, and the user clicks into it on purpose to edit the marker.
 * Hauling that click to the content would both fight the intent and make a position the arrow keys
 * can reach unreachable by mouse. So the question this asks is about the NODE at the paragraph's
 * start — can it hold the caret? — never about which view is on screen.
 *
 * Also corrects a `BookNode`'s `\id` line the same way: its immutable `\id GEN ` prefix hosts no
 * caret either, and the line has no paragraph arm to fall back on.
 *
 * Returns `true` if the selection was corrected, `false` if no correction was needed.
