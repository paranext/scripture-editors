/**
 * Regression coverage for the no-flush fix: `OnSelectionChangePlugin`'s
 * `SELECTION_CHANGE_COMMAND` handler used to call `editor.read($getUsjSelectionFromEditor)`.
 * `LexicalEditor.read()` unconditionally calls `$commitPendingUpdates` — even when invoked from
 * inside an already-active (uncommitted) `editor.update()`. That force-flush is exactly the
 * enabler of the frozen-commit crash class fixed for `MarkerEditPlugin` in
 * `packages/platform/src/editor/markerEdit/markerEditComposed.test.tsx`: a
 * plugin that synchronously self-dispatches `SELECTION_CHANGE_COMMAND` from inside an in-flight
 * update hits `OnSelectionChangePlugin`'s handler, which force-commits (and, in dev builds,
 * freezes) the still-in-flight pending state mid-dispatch; any further mutation attempted by the
 * outer update after that point then writes into the now-frozen state and throws.
 *
 * That composed reproduction lives in `platform` (it needs `MarkerEditPlugin` to supply the
 * self-dispatch); this file reproduces the same mechanism directly against
 * `OnSelectionChangePlugin` alone, without a platform dependency, by performing the nested
 * `dispatchCommand(SELECTION_CHANGE_COMMAND, ...)` inline (mirroring the shape of the composed
 * test's "one update moves the caret AND dispatches SELECTION_CHANGE within it").
