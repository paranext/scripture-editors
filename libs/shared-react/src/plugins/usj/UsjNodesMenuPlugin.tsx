 * The IN-EDITOR marker menu for editable marker modes (standard view): a document-first

 * bring its own UI — the repo's demos. A host that does
 * (`EditorOptions.hasExternalUI`, e.g. Platform.Bible, which renders marker menus through its
 * own overlay service) never mounts the plugin, so none of this runs there.
 *
 * The `\` palette is ACTIVE (owner-directed, 2026-08-18, superseding the earlier passive
 * design): the trigger preventDefaults in EVERY selection shape, so neither the `\` nor any
 * subsequent typing reaches the document — typed characters filter the palette instead, in
 * every context (collapsed caret, selection, note content alike). Escape always just closes,
 * leaving the document untouched (nothing landed that could need cleaning up).
 *
 * Space commits WHAT WAS TYPED, preserving the end states passive typing settles to:
 * - Collapsed caret: the typed query is materialized at the caret as the SAME literal bytes
 *   passive typing would have accumulated (`\` + query + space) in one update, and Tier 2
 *   resolves them exactly as it resolved passive typing — open span `closed="false"` for an
 *   inline marker (no auto-closer), unknown markers settle as typed, and `\f ` tokenizes to
 *   the full note (the "commits like Enter" row, emergent from the tokenizer, not a palette
 *   branch). Byte-identical by construction; the palette re-implements none of it.
 * - Non-collapsed selection: an EXACT match of the typed query against the offered entries
 *   commits the wrap (the same closed span the Enter commit produces). A marker that is not
 *   offered commits nothing: the palette closes and the selection is left untouched, rather
 *   than the space replacing the selected text or a near-miss entry being applied as a guess.
 *   (A wrap has no literal for Tier 2 to settle, so the unknown-settles-as-typed row cannot
 *   apply here — the refusal is deliberate and visible.)
 *
 * `*` is the palette's second commit key, for CLOSING markers, in EVERY selection shape: it
 * commits `\` + query + `*` and closes, with no terminating space and no opening glyph. The bytes
 * land and the engine resolves them — against a matching open span they become that span's real
 * closer, otherwise they settle as an unmatched closer, flagged as typed. Over a NON-COLLAPSED
 * selection the selected content is DELETED and the closer lands in its place, which is Paratext
 * 9's behavior for typing `\nd*` with text selected — a different gesture from Space's WRAP, which
 * is why the two keys are not interchangeable over a selection. Because `*` commits, it is never a
 * filter character, so a `closeTag` entry can no longer be narrowed to by typing its trailing `*`;
 * pressing `*` commits the end state that entry would have applied.
 *
 * The user's Enter keystroke is intercepted on `KEY_ENTER_COMMAND` at `COMMAND_PRIORITY_NORMAL`
 * - below `MarkerEditPlugin`'s `COMMAND_PRIORITY_HIGH` claims (in-note `\fp`, in-marker
 * completion swallow), above rich-text's fallback - to offer the Enter/SmartEnter paragraph menu
 * instead of splitting. Listening on the KEYSTROKE rather than `INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND` keeps
 * every programmatic `INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND` dispatch (multi-line paste replays, the
 * needs-plain-split re-dispatch) on its real split path — a command-level claim intercepted those
 * too, popping a menu per pasted line and swallowing the splits. A `getContext()` returning
 * `undefined` (readonly / no selection) passes through untouched.
 *
 * Reuses `NodeSelectionMenu`'s existing query-capture keydown handling (filters/Escape/
 * Backspace once open) rather than rebuilding it, mirroring the palette focus model the legacy
 * typeahead below already uses.

   *
   * A NOTE marker commits through the item commit — the same one Enter uses — rather than through
