/**
 * Editable-mode display separators after opening char glyphs: the single place that owns HOW the
 * space the user sees after `\nd` is represented and kept in sync. Sibling of
 * nestedGlyphs.utils.ts, which owns the glyph `+` the same way.
 *
 * ## The convention
 *
 * In editable marker mode an opening char glyph (`\nd`) is followed on screen by a separator —
 * the space PT9 shows and the serializer writes after the marker. That separator is
 * PRESENTATION-ONLY state: the USFM writer emits the space after an opening marker structurally
 * and the tokenizer consumes it, so no separator ever lives in USJ content or in the saved bytes
 * as data. In the editor it is an NBSP (never a plain space, so it cannot word-wrap away from its
 * glyph), stored as:
 *
 * - a prefix of the following text (`\nd` + `⍽one`) when the glyph is directly followed by plain
 *   text — the shape `createChar` (usj-editor.adaptor), `$splitCharNodeAt`, and the marker-apply
 *   paths build, and the reverse adaptor strips on save;
 * - a standalone NBSP text node when the glyph is directly followed by an element (a nested char
 *   span, note, milestone, or verse: `\nd` + `⍽` + `\+wj …`) — NBSP-only text nodes are
 *   presentation-only by convention (`$shouldIgnoreNodeForContentIndexes`) and dropped by the
 *   editor→USJ conversion.
 *
 * ## Keeping it in sync
 *
 * Builders construct the separator (transforms do not run on `setEditorState`, so loaded states
 * must render correctly as-is), and {@link $syncOpenerSeparators} — registered as a CharNode
 * transform in CharNodePlugin — re-derives it whenever a span is dirtied, healing paths that
 * restructure spans without rebuilding them through an adaptor. Deleting the separator is
 * semantically a no-op (the writer emits the space regardless), so healing it back is display
 * canonicalization, exactly like Tier-2's rebuild produces — but deleting must still be
 * ALLOWED: while the collapsed caret sits at the deletion point the sync leaves the gap alone
 * (mid-edit grace), and the marker-edit engine settles it back on caret departure by pending
 * spans reported by {@link $hasCaretHeldSeparatorGap} into its Tier-2 completion path.
 *
 * Only char-span glyphs take a separator — a milestone's display run inside a span is left
 * alone — so which glyphs qualify is decided by the same classifier the nested-`+` sync uses
 * ({@link $charGlyphNestedValue}).
