/**
 * Attribute display runs: the single place that owns HOW a node's USFM attribute bytes
 * (`|lemma="grace" strong="G5485"`, `|gloss`) are rendered as engine-owned display text and kept
 * in sync. Sibling of nestedGlyphs.utils.ts (glyph `+`) and markerSeparators.utils.ts (opener
 * separators), following the same owning-module shape.
 *
 * ## The representations (who owns what)
 *
 * - **Node state is the truth.** Char-span attributes live in `CharNode.__unknownAttributes`;
 *   milestone attributes in `MilestoneNode` props + `__unknownAttributes`; a verse's `\va`/`\vp`
 *   values in `VerseNode.__altnumber`/`__pubnumber`. The display run is a derived cache, never a
 *   second store.
 * - **The display run** is a TextNode tagged textType "attribute" holding the canonical PT9 byte
 *   form produced by {@link canonicalAttributeText}: a lone default attribute collapses to
 *   `|value`; anything else is `|name="value" …` (double quotes, single spaces, insertion
 *   order). `closed` is derived metadata, never displayed. Char runs are bare `|…` directly
 *   before the closing glyph (PT9's shape; an NBSP prefix would flatten to a space and leak
 *   into span content on a Tier-2 rebuild). Milestone runs keep the NBSP+`|` prefix — that NBSP
 *   flattens to the space genuinely in the file (`\qt-s |sid="…"\*`). A verse's `\va`/`\vp`
 *   values aren't `name="value"` attribute bytes at all — PT9 displays them as their own
 *   `MarkerNode` open + NBSP-prefixed value TextNode + `MarkerNode` close triplet, riding as the
 *   verse's FOLLOWING SIBLINGS (a `VerseNode` is itself a TextNode, not a container). A
 *   milestone's run is shaped the same way — opening `MarkerNode` + optional NBSP-prefixed
 *   attribute TextNode + self-closing `MarkerNode` `\*`, riding as the `MilestoneNode`'s
 *   FOLLOWING SIBLINGS (a `MilestoneNode` is a `DecoratorNode`, so it cannot hold children
 *   either) — except the glyphs themselves are unconditional: a milestone always shows its
 *   opening/self-closing pair, with only the middle attribute text coming and going.
 * - **Excluded from data paths**: textType "attribute" text never enters OT content ops or the
 *   editor→USJ conversion; the Tier-2 fragment is the one place it DOES flow, so edited bytes
 *   re-tokenize back into node state (extractAttributes / scanMilestone).
 *
 * ## Keeping the cache honest
 *
 * Builders construct the run (usj-editor.adaptor's `createChar`/`addAttributes`/
 * `addVerseAttributes`; transforms do not run on `setEditorState`). A char span's own run, a
 * verse's `\va`/`\vp` runs, and a milestone's run all follow the identical contract through the
 * shared `$syncDisplayRun` driver (displayRunSync.utils.ts), parameterized by each kind's own
 * descriptor rather than defined in this module — re-deriving the run whenever its owner is
 * dirtied, healing remote collab updates (the collab materializer's `$createMilestone` builds a
 * BARE `MilestoneNode` with no run at all — delta-apply-update.utils.ts) and structure surgery.
 * While the collapsed caret sits inside the run the sync leaves it alone (mid-edit grace); the
 * marker-edit engine settles it on caret departure by pending the edited run into its Tier-2
 * completion path — the displayed bytes re-tokenize back into node state (last-write-wins,
 * uniformly across chars, verses, and milestones), and a milestone whose run was deleted OUTRIGHT
 * (the shared `$runEntirelyAbsent` check, displayRunSync.utils.ts, parameterized by the milestone
 * descriptor) is itself removed, since the run is its entire byte representation. `MilestoneNode`
 * is the SAME type in every mode — unlike the char/verse EDITABLE node types, which never appear
 * outside editable mode — so its sync is registered only in `MarkerEditPlugin.tsx`, which is itself
 * markerMode-"editable"-gated, to keep visible/hidden mode's `ImmutableTypedTextNode`-based
 * milestone runs (built by the adaptor, never edited) untouched.

/**
 * A milestone's display-run pieces, scanned tolerantly in their fixed order — opening
 * `MarkerNode` (matching `milestone`'s own marker), attribute TextNode (textType "attribute"),
 * self-closing `MarkerNode` — with EACH piece individually optional: a bare collab-materialized
 * milestone has none of them, and a mid-edit tree can be missing any subset (only the opening
 * deleted leaves attribute + closer debris; only the closer deleted leaves opening + attribute).
 * The tolerant scan lets callers repair only the genuinely missing/stale pieces around whatever
 * survives — never duplicating a leftover — and lets the shared `$runEntirelyAbsent` check
 * (displayRunSync.utils.ts, parameterized by the milestone descriptor) distinguish "every byte of
 * the run deleted" from a partial mangle. Exported as the single definition of "a milestone's run"
 * — the Tier-2 rebuild's `$milestoneDisplayRun` delegates to it so the sync and the rebuild can
 * never disagree about which siblings make up the run.
 *
 * When `milestone`'s immediately following sibling is an `AttributeRunNode` whose `runKind` is
 * `"milestone"`, the SAME tolerant scan runs over the wrapper's CHILDREN instead of `milestone`'s
 * siblings — a wrapper's children are the run's pieces in the identical fixed order, so
 * redirecting the cursor's starting point is the only change needed. The adaptor always builds
 * this shape now; the sync still heals whichever shape — loose siblings (a pre-flip editor state,
 * an undo stack, or a collab-materialized bare milestone) or an existing wrapper — is actually in
 * the tree.
 *
 * As in {@link $verseAttributeRunPieces}, a glyph counts as a piece only while its rendered bytes
 * still spell what its state describes ({@link $isCanonicalMarkerNode}) — a byte-damaged glyph is
 * reported absent so the run diverges and the caret can grace the mid-edit shape.
