/**
 * The character-style STACK: closing every char span open at a point and reopening the ones that
 * still have content after it. Sibling of charGlyphs.utils.ts, which owns the shape of each span
 * this module builds.
 *
 * ## Why one primitive
 *
 * Paratext 9 has no bespoke algorithm for this. Its `StyleApplicator` closes the open character
 * styles before the point and reopens the still-active ones after it, and every operation that
 * interrupts styled text — applying a non-nesting style, an unformatted space, a footnote-paragraph
 * break, a paragraph split — is the same close-and-reopen with a different thing placed in the gap.
 * Reimplemented per caller, that operation came out right in one place and wrong in four.
 *
 * ## Ordering falls out of the loop, not out of ordering code
 *
 * {@link $liftOutOfChar} closes the ONE span holding the node and reopens a continuation after it.
 * {@link $liftOutOfCharStack} iterates that outwards. Each iteration's continuation lands in the
 * next iteration's "content after the node" set, so the closers emerge innermost-to-outermost and
 * the openers outermost-to-innermost with no explicit ordering step:
 *
 * ```
 * \wj \+nd thing\+nd*\wj*   ->   \wj \+nd thi\+nd*\wj* <node> \wj \+nd ng\+nd*\wj*
 * ```
 *
 * PT9 gets the reopen order WRONG for nested styles — its reopen loop walks the style list
 * innermost-first and emits index 0 without the `+`, so a two-deep stack comes back with the
 * markers swapped. That path has no PT9 test coverage. We port the intent, not the code.
