/**
 * Nested inline-marker glyphs: the single place that owns HOW the `+` prefix (`\+w …\+w*`) is
 * represented and kept in sync.
 *
 * ## The representations (who owns what)
 *
 * - **Tree containment is the truth.** A char span is nested iff its parent is another CharNode
 *   ({@link $isNestedCharNode}) — exactly USJ/USX's model, where nesting is element containment
 *   and no `+` exists in any marker name.
 * - **Markers are always CLEAN** (`"w"`, never `"+w"`), in CharNode state, in USJ, and in the
 *   OT/collab delta (which conveys nesting by char-ARRAY position, outermost-first; see
 *   `$buildCharItem` in editor-delta.adaptor and `$createNestedChars` in delta-apply-update —
 *   both in `shared-react`'s collab plugin).
 * - **Only the rendered glyph text carries the `+`** — USFM's serialization of nesting, and PT9's
 *   on-screen display for USFM ≤3.0. `MarkerNode` caches it: Lexical renders a TextNode's stored
 *   `__text` (there is no computed-text hook, and nothing re-runs when an ANCESTOR moves), so the
 *   `+` must be baked into `__text`. `MarkerNode.__nested` is the flag that `getMarkerText`
 *   derives it from — see MarkerNode.ts, which points back here.
 *
 * ## Keeping the cache honest
 *
 * Because `__text` is a cache of tree-derived state, every path that BUILDS glyphs sets `nested`
 * at construction (the USJ load adaptor's `createChar`, `$splitCharNodeAt`, the marker-apply
 * paths, the collab materializer) — construction-time correctness matters because transforms do
 * not run on `setEditorState` (initial load / restored states render straight from serialized
 * `__text`). {@link $syncNestedGlyphs} is the safety net for everything AFTER load: registered as
 * a CharNode transform (CharNodePlugin in `shared-react`), it re-derives each glyph's `nested`
 * from tree position whenever a span is dirtied, so structure surgery that forgets to refresh
 * glyphs (a move, an unwrap, a merge) self-heals instead of leaving a stale `+` that Tier-2
 * re-tokenization would misread (`\+w` with nothing open parses as an unknown marker; a missing
 * `+` flattens the nesting via close-on-bare).
