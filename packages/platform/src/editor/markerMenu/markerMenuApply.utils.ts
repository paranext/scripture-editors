/**
 * Marker-menu apply — turns a `MarkerMenuItem` selection into an editor mutation.
 * Port of PT9's `MarkerDropdownEditHandler`/`KeyPressEditHandler` "apply" step
 * (`MarkerDropdownEditHandler.cs`), adapted to the Lexical tree:
 * - `applyMarkerMenuSelection` — character/note ("open") kinds run the existing
 *   structural-insert action (`getUsjMarkerAction`), first deleting a literal `\marker` trigger
 *   prefix typed before the caret when one landed (`MarkerDropdownControl.cs:216-219`);
 *   paragraph kinds retag the current paragraph at content start or split it mid-text (PT9
 *   reformat semantics — see `$applyParagraphSelection`); `closeTag` kind lands the literal
 *   `\marker*` bytes instead, through the same {@link $commitTypedCloser} the `*` key uses.
 *   One in-note special case: `fp` picked with the caret in expanded note content performs the
 *   footnote-paragraph BREAK (`$handleEnterInNote` — the same break Enter makes there), not a
 *   span insertion.
 * - `splitParagraphWithMarker` — the Enter-triggered marker menu's apply step: splits the
 *   paragraph at the caret and gives the new paragraph the chosen marker.
 *
 * Both are called from `EditorRef.applyMarkerMenuSelection`/`EditorRef.splitParagraphWithMarker`
 * (`Editor.tsx`) inside `editor.update(...)`.

 * nesting instead of degrading to the glyph-less continuation the deletion transform unwraps.
 * The primitive parks the caret INSIDE the innermost reopened span (typing continues the

 * a caret sitting at the paragraph's start, whereas `$setParaMarkerWithPrefix` would drag it

 * promises are never built.
 *
 * A caret in the `\id` line has no paragraph to split at all and routes to
 * {@link $splitBookWithMarker} instead. Both marker-menu triggers reach it through here — the
 * Enter menu calls this directly (`EditorRef.splitParagraphWithMarker`), the `\` menu through
 * `$applyParagraphSelection` — so the book arm belongs on this path, not on either caller's. The
 * routing is judged from the selection's START point (`isBackward() ? focus : anchor`), so a
