/*
 * ============================================================================================
 * HOW THIS PLUGIN WORKS - READ BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * Contract: the host owns `scrRef`; this plugin (a) applies scrRef changes to the caret and
 * (b) reports genuine user caret moves back via `onScrRefChange`. Exactly two emission shapes
 * exist, both produced only by `report()`:
 *   - position report: chapter + verse read from the loaded document in ONE snapshot, with the
 *     book from that same snapshot's BookNode - falling back to the scrRef prop's book ONLY
 *     when the document has no book code (a book-less document cannot name its own book, and
 *     corrections never fire there, so the prop is the sole authority) - and the prop's
 *     versificationStr riding along (a document states no versification);
 *   - book correction: { ...scrRef, book: <document's book> } - the one deliberate mixed-source
 *     shape ("keep your position, fix the book"), for documents whose book differs from scrRef.
 *
 * Why this file is shaped the way it is - three async signals meet here, plus a feedback loop:
 *   1. the scrRef prop (the host's intent - never wrong, but everything else lags it);
 *   2. document content (arrives a USJ-load later than the intent it belongs to; a SUPERSEDED
 *      navigation's document can land after a NEWER navigation started);
 *   3. selection events (browser macrotasks; can describe positions that are already obsolete);
 *   4. our own emissions return as the scrRef prop (the echo loop).
 *
 * The races these caused (regression tests exist for each):
 *   R1 echo treated as navigation      -> caret yanked mid-typing
 *   R2 settle reported as a user move  -> verse resets to 0 (e.g. 78:9 -> 78:0 on reattach)
 *   R3 stale queued selectionchange    -> rapid navigation hijacked back to a previous target
 *   R4 superseded document lands late  -> navigation hijacked to an abandoned target
 *   R5 mixed-source emissions          -> references that describe no real position
 *   R6 doc mutations mid-navigation    -> old book echoed during cross-book navigation
 *
 * The machine: phase is "idle" or "navigating" (see NavPhase). We call the span where
 * phase === "navigating" the "navigation window". While "navigating", this plugin emits NOTHING
 * (kills R2, R3, R4, R6). The navigation window opens on any external scrRef change, after emitting
 * a book correction, or on a document REPLACEMENT while idle (a same-book reload's own settle
 * transiently resolves verse 0 - reporting it is the R2 clobber; pinned by test). It closes on real
 * user input (pointerdown/keydown/beforeinput on the root - beforeinput catches IME/voice/paste
 * input paths that move the selection without a pointerdown or keydown) or when one of our own
 * emissions echoes back as the prop. `pendingEchoes` (a FIFO, deliberately not a
 * boolean or a single slot) recognizes echoes (kills R1). `report()` enforces the two emission
 * shapes and dedupes (kills R5). `$resolvePosition` refuses to describe positions the document
 * cannot address; content before the first chapter of a loaded document addresses as chapter 1
 * verse 0 by USFM convention - verse 0 is DATA here, never a sentinel.
 *
 * Invariants (each backed by a named test in ScriptureReferencePlugin.test.tsx):
 *   I1 single-source        position reports come from one document snapshot (book falls back
 *                           to the prop only when the document has no book code;
 *                           versificationStr always rides from the prop - a document has none)
 *   I2 navigating-silence   zero emissions while navigating
 *   I3 echo-inert           echoed props never move the caret nor open a navigation window
 *   I4 user-report          after user input, the next differing selection reports (sole
 *                           exception: the pending-echo dedupe trade-off below)
 *   I5 resolved-position    never emit a position the document cannot address
 *   I6 placement-book-gate  prop-driven placement never moves the caret in a different book's
 *                           document; arrival-driven placement targets the arriving document only
 *   I7 mount-correction     a mounted document with a mismatched book corrects the host once
 *   I8 verse-0-is-data      verse 0 reports from idle and applies as a target
 *   I9 one-verse-question   the caret's verse is resolved ONE way ($resolveVerseNode +
 *                           $getEffectiveVerseForBcv), for reporting and for the "already here"
 *                           no-op alike - so a position between two verses belongs to the same
 *                           verse whichever of the two asks
 *
 * Documented trade-offs (deliberate; do not "fix" one without weighing its counterpart):
 *   - A late echo arriving after a newer external navigation cleared the queue is treated as a
 *     real navigation (pinned: "treats an echo arriving after a newer external navigation...").
 *   - A user selection equal to a STILL-PENDING echo of an earlier report is deduped, not
 *     re-emitted - report() cannot distinguish it from the echo. The host may briefly hold a
 *     newer ref than the caret; the next differing selection self-heals. Emitting instead would
 *     leave a never-consumed echo in the FIFO that would later swallow a REAL navigation to that
 *     ref - strictly worse. This is the sole exception to I4.
 *   - A cross-editor paste or undo that (re)creates a BookNode while a document is already loaded
 *     triggers neither placement nor a navigation window: pastes must not teleport the caret to
 *     verse start (pinned).
 *
 * UNSAFE without re-running the full test suite AND the live Platform.Bible repros:
 *   - re-registering any listener on chapter/verse deps (skipInitialization replay fires against
 *     whatever document happens to be mounted - this exact mistake caused the NUM 27:1 bug);
 *   - emitting anything while phase === "navigating" (no "genuine jump" carve-outs: every such
 *     carve-out forces settle-shape classification, which is how verse-0 sentinels are born);
 *   - collapsing pendingEchoes to a boolean or single slot (two reports can be in flight);
 *   - building an emission from more than one source (except the book-correction shape and
 *     I1's documented no-book fallback);
 *   - calling `editor.read()` anywhere in this file: it runs `$commitPendingUpdates` - a full
 *     synchronous commit that installs any pending document swap and fires every listener,
 *     including ours - and NO test catches it (all 37 stay green). Use
 *     `editor.getEditorState().read()` (see getCommittedBookCode) for the committed snapshot.
 *
 * SAFE (additive) changes:
 *   - adding more events that close the navigation window;
 *   - placement internals ($moveCaretToVerseStart), as long as it stays a pure caret move;
 *   - additional validity checks before report().

  // trailing bytes land outside the span and the literal never re-tokenizes (`\nd text|x="y"\nd*`
  // stays literal forever). A range that contains the target, or a single verse whose number is
  // the target — IN THE SAME CHAPTER — both mean "already here", so leave the caret untouched. This
  // is also the deliberate UX no-op for clicking the verse the caret is already in: it is left
  // where the user placed it, not snapped to the verse start. Genuine cross-verse OR cross-chapter

/**
 * Parks the caret at the very start of `verse`'s content — immediately after the space that follows
 * the verse number, and BEFORE anything that content opens with: a note caller, a char span, a
 * milestone. Verse navigation names a location in the text; it must never step over content to
 * reach it, so the caret lands on the same side of the verse's first thing every time.
 *
 * That position is the boundary just past the verse marker. Naming it is easy; expressing it as a
 * point the browser will actually DRAW a caret at is the work, because the obvious spellings fail:
 *
 * - `verse.selectNext(0, 0)` selects INTO the following node. When that is a collapsed note, Lexical
 *   resolves it to the note's own `\f`/`\x` glyph — hidden while collapsed — and the caret vanishes.
 * - the boundary's element point (`para.select(i, i)`) draws nothing at all when no text node
 *   follows it. Measured in the app: `Range.getClientRects()` returns 0 there.
 * - walking FORWARD to the next node that can host a caret does draw one, but on the wrong side of
 *   the caller — the reported bug this replaces.
 *
 * So the position is expressed, in order of preference, as:
 *
 * 1. offset 0 of the text node that follows the boundary — plain content, the common case;
 * 2. the END of the verse marker itself, when the marker is editable text (Standard/Unformatted
 *    views, where a verse is a `VerseNode` whose text is literally `\v 9 `). That is the same screen
 *    location — after the marker's own trailing space, left of the caller — and it is already where
 *    arrow navigation rests when walking leftward out of the verse's content;
 * 3. the first text at the START of a char span that opens the verse, when the marker is an
 *    immutable decorator and so cannot host anything. Descending is still the boundary, not past it:
 *    only the first-child chain is followed, never a later sibling. A note is never descended into —
 *    a caller is an annotation hanging off the verse, not the start of its text;
 * 4. the boundary's element point. An empty verse (nothing follows, or the next verse marker does)
 *    always takes this branch, deliberately: it is the state `EmptyVerseCaretGuardPlugin` detects
 *    and repairs with a caret host of its own, and the caret must not borrow the next verse's text.
