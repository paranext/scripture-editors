/**
 * The single authority for what a MARKER NAME is in the editor's byte-level regexes.
 *
 * USFM 3.x marker syntax: a marker is a backslash `\` followed by a lowercase alphanumeric name —
 * letters then an optional digit suffix (`\p`, `\q1`, `\th2`) — and milestone names additionally
 * carry a hyphenated suffix (`\qt-s`, `\ts-e`). Nested character markers PREFIX the name with `+`
 * (`\+nd`), and a closing marker SUFFIXES it with `*` (`\nd*`); the `+`/`*` are marker syntax, not
 * name bytes. (USFM documentation: "Markers", "Character styles > Nesting", "Milestones".)
 *
 * Two byte classes exist DELIBERATELY, and every marker-name regex in the editor derives from one
 * of them — the derivations below are the only places the classes are spelled:
 *
 * - {@link ENGINE_MARKER_NAME_BYTES} — the liberal class (`\w` plus `-`) the marker-edit engine
 *   uses to RECOGNIZE a marker-shaped byte run mid-edit. Wider than canonical USFM (uppercase,
 *   `_`) on purpose: the tokenizer's own name scan runs to the next whitespace/`\`/`|`/`*`
 *   (usfmFragmentToUsj.ts), so a wrong-case or unknown name is still a marker-shaped edit that
 *   must pend and re-tokenize rather than sit unnoticed in content.
 * - {@link CANONICAL_MARKER_NAME_BYTES} — the strict class canonical USFM names are built from
 *   (lowercase letters and digits), for sites CLASSIFYING a name against the stylesheet rather
 *   than detecting an edit.
 *
 * Sites needing a semantic the authority cannot express as a variant (e.g. the tokenizer's
 * scan-based rule itself) do not import from here; keeping the byte classes single-sourced is the
 * goal, not forcing every marker test through one regex.
