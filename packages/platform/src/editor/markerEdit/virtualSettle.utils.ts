/**
 * The READ-ONLY settle. `EditorRef.getUsj()` must hand consumers the canonical document — the one a
 * Tier-2 settle would produce — while the user's pending edits stay pending on screen. Settling is
 * re-tokenization of displayed bytes, which is a pure computation, so this recomputes it into the
 * OUTPUT instead of mutating the editor: it runs the SAME fragment build + tokenize + serialize
 * pipeline `$rebuildParas`/`$rebuildNoteContent` run, over a throwaway JSON copy of the editor
 * state.
 *
 * The one half that cannot be literally shared with the mutating rebuild is materialization: a real
 * settle parses the tokenizer's output into live nodes and splices them into the tree, and Lexical
 * forbids creating nodes inside a `read()`. So the splice happens in the SERIALIZED domain here —
 * the same `usjEditorAdaptor.serializeEditorState` output the mutating path parses, spliced as JSON
 * — and one `deserializeSerializedEditorState` (editor-usj.adaptor.ts) over the patched document produces
 * the result, so text coalescing, implied-para flattening, and every display-byte exclusion gate
 * behave exactly as they do for an unsettled read. That divergence is this module's standing
 * risk: the
 * mutating and read-only halves must always agree on what a given scope settles to, which is why
 * every guard rail, sentinel-symmetry check, and splice order here is a direct mirror of
 * `$rebuildParas`/`$rebuildNoteContent` rather than an independent re-derivation — an equivalence
 * property this module's own tests hold the two halves to, scope by scope.
 *
 * Uniform by design: there is NO caret-held exception. A half-typed `|stuf` settles to literal
 * content in the output, because that is what those bytes mean to anything downstream that parses
 * them; the mutating settle's caret grace exists to avoid re-tokenizing under a live caret, which a
 * computation that never touches the tree cannot do.

 *
 * Compares the two SEQUENCES of collected markers (`$liveStructuralMarkers`/

 * positional over the full node lists. `rebuilt` is read PRE-`replaceSerializedSentinels` (see
 * both call sites), where a preserved run (e.g. a note sitting between two plain-text runs)
 * collapses into ONE JSON text node carrying the sentinel character inline, while the live side
 * still has the run as its own separate node(s) — a raw positional walk bounded by the shorter
 * array would silently stop short of comparing anything after that point, including an unrelated
 * char span's own pending rename further along in the SAME scope (both halves of the fixed-point
 * check would then pass on a genuinely un-settled paragraph, silently reverting the rename in the
 * output — the exact inverse of the divergence this check exists to catch). Comparing filtered,
 * order-preserving SEQUENCES instead sidesteps the array-length mismatch entirely: only the
 * RELATIVE ORDER of Para/CharNode markers matters, never their raw position among unrelated
 * siblings.
 *
 * Safe to trust a mismatched sequence LENGTH as "not a fixed point" (rather than an error) for
 * the same reason a genuine structural difference is already safe here at all: the signature
 * string comparison this function is gated behind already guarantees the same COUNT and nesting
 * of "char"-tagged spans among NON-OPAQUE content on both sides. It says nothing about markers
 * INSIDE an opaque sentinel (a note, an unknown block, …), which the signature collapses to one
 * character without ever looking inside — which is exactly why `$liveStructuralMarkers` must
 * ALSO refuse to look inside one (see its own doc comment): without that gate, an unrelated
 * sentinel's own nested char/para markers would inflate the live sequence with entries the JSON
 * side, and the signature, both have no way to represent — a spurious length mismatch on a
 * paragraph that IS a genuine fixed point, forcing a needless, data-lossy rebuild.

 * equivalent" is not "byte-identical": a structural NBSP separator and a user's own literal typed

 * all.
 *
 * A scope carrying a resolved `transient` necessarily forgoes the fixed-point refusal below while
 * the declaration is live: the comparison is always against `$signatureOf(paras, ...)`, the
 * UNMODIFIED live signature, which by construction differs from a rebuild of the reduced text
 * whenever the cut actually removed anything. That is inherent, not a gap — a subtraction and a
 * "refuse because nothing changed" check cannot both fire on the same bytes — and the direction is

  //  - NOTE and BOOK: the notes pass's splice (`noteChildren.splice(start, ..., ...built.rebuilt)`)
  //    and the book pass's splice (`bookChildren.splice(start, ..., ...built.rebuilt)`) both
  //    mutate their children array IN PLACE — the SAME array object this loop's own
  //    `site.siblings` points to for the husk (both were recorded from that same children array by
  //    `$mapSerializedSites`). `built.rebuilt` already excludes the husk (via `huskKeys`), so by
  //    the time this loop runs, the husk's own JSON node genuinely no longer exists anywhere in
  //    that array; `indexOf` returns -1 and `continue` is a real no-op.
  //  - PARAGRAPH: `$settledParaNodes` returns a WHOLLY FRESH top-level node, and the para pass's
  //    splice (`site.siblings.splice(index, 1, ...rebuilt)`, keyed on the PARAGRAPH's own site)
  //    replaces the paragraph's OWN SLOT in its PARENT's children array — it never touches the
  //    OLD paragraph's own children array (where the husk's site.siblings still points). That old
  //    array is simply orphaned, disconnected from the document the moment the paragraph's slot is
  //    replaced, but it is NOT mutated, so `indexOf` still FINDS the husk there and the splice
  //    below still runs — harmlessly, since removing a node from an array nothing reads anymore
  //    has no observable effect on the final output either way.
  //
  // Running this pass FIRST (as an earlier version of this settle did) breaks a different way: the
  // notes pass (and, identically, the book pass) anchors its splice on `built.contentNodes[0]`'s
  // serialized site — if a husk is a note's, paragraph's, or the book line's OWN first content
  // node, an earlier husk-first splice has already spliced that exact JSON node out of the
  // relevant children array, so `indexOf(firstSite.node)` can no longer find it, `start < 0`
