 * abstraction to be shared, and a duplicated copy of one is pure drift risk — the two halves are

/**
 * A CharNode's own direct child, for signature purposes, given that child's display text as it
 * stands BEFORE `toFragmentText` normalization — the mirror of `editor-usj.adaptor.ts`'s TWO
 * SEPARATE structural-NBSP rules for a char's own content, which this must reproduce exactly, not
 * conflate into one:
 *
 * 1. TEXT-FIRST content: `createChar` (usj-editor.adaptor.ts) prepends a structural NBSP directly
 *    onto the first content child's OWN text (`\u00A0name`, a MIXED node — separator plus real
 *    content). Extraction strips exactly that one leading NBSP (`isCharChild &&
 *    text.startsWith(NBSP) -> text.slice(1)`), keeping the rest as real content. Mirrored here by
 *    stripping one leading NBSP off text that is LONGER than just that one character.
 * 2. ELEMENT-FIRST content (a nested char/note/milestone/verse comes first): `createChar` instead
 *    inserts a whole SEPARATE text node containing NOTHING BUT that one NBSP (a pure spacer, never
 *    merged with anything). Extraction drops such a node WHOLESALE (`text !== NBSP`), but the node
 *    itself is real, structural evidence that a separator IS present — as opposed to a live tree
 *    missing one, e.g. right after a user deletes the text between an opening glyph and a sentinel
 *    span. Left UNSTRIPPED here (returned as-is, so the caller's `toFragmentText` turns it into a
 *    plain " "), so the signature still tells "has a separator" apart from "has none at all" for
 *    this shape.
 *
 *    One narrow, ACCEPTED consequence of rule 2 being keyed on shape rather than provenance: a
 *    pure spacer node NOT actually followed by an element — a `glyph + pure-NBSP-spacer + plain
 *    TEXT sibling` shape `createChar` itself never produces (only a hand-built fixture or a
 *    pre-heal collab state would), since ordinary text-first content always uses rule 1's single
 *    merged node instead — no longer coincidentally signature-matches a fresh rebuild's own merged
 *    `NBSP + text` node, so the paragraph is no longer refused as a fixed point and converges to
 *    that canonical merged form on its next touch. A converging canonicalization, not a
 *    data-loss risk: the represented content is identical either way, only the node count changes.
 *
 * `toFragmentText`'s blanket NBSP->space normalization, which each caller applies to this
 * function's RESULT, cannot make either distinction on its own — a structural separator and a
 * user's own literal typed space both collapse to the same plain space — so without rule 1, a live
 * char content run holding exactly one user-typed space can signature-match a fresh rebuild's own
 * single structural NBSP by coincidence, and the fixed-point check refuses a rebuild that
 * editor->USJ extraction would actually have produced DIFFERENT bytes for. Without rule 2 kept
 * narrow to MIXED nodes only, a pure spacer node would collapse to nothing, making "a separator is
 * present" signature-indistinguishable from "no separator at all" — silently defeating the
 * fixed-point check's OTHER job of noticing a missing display separator needs restoring
 * (tier2Rebuild.utils.test.tsx's "rebuilds (not aborts) when a sentinel span directly follows an
 * opening glyph").
 *
 * This runs BEFORE either settle splices its preserved nodes back in (`$replaceSentinels` /
 * `replaceSerializedSentinels`, each call site's own comment explains why): a fresh rebuild's
 * would-be rule-2 spacer has NOT been split out into its own node yet at this point — it is still
 * fused, in the SAME string, with the raw {@link ATOMIC_SENTINEL} placeholder character standing in
 * for whatever preserved node follows it (e.g. `"\u00A0￼e"`, not yet `"\u00A0"` + the preserved
 * node + `"e"`). Stripping that NBSP by LENGTH alone would misread rule 2 as rule 1 the moment ANY
 * content follows the placeholder inline. Checking the very next character is the placeholder
 * itself catches it before the split: that is exactly the position the splice cuts at, leaving the
 * NBSP standing alone afterward — the same rule-2 shape as an unedited nested-char span, which
 * never has a placeholder to begin with and is caught by the plain length check.
 *
 * Shared verbatim by both settles: the live side reads its child's text off a `TextNode` first, the
 * serialized side reads it off a JSON `text` field, and from there the rule is one string-to-string
 * computation.
