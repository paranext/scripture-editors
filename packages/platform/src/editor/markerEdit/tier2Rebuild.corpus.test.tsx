/**
 * Corpus losslessness property test — the marker-edit engine's cross-cutting safety net.
 *
 * Every part of the marker-edit engine (char-span attribute display, milestone re-tokenization,
 * recoverability-based sentinel classification, and the fixed-point signature that folds in char
 * `unknownAttributes` and milestone node state) exists to keep one invariant true: display bytes
 * built from real project data re-tokenize back to themselves. This test pins that invariant
 * directly, over real corpus data, instead of trusting the unit tests in `tier2Rebuild.utils.test.tsx`
 * to have anticipated every shape.
 *
 * For every paragraph in the 2SA corpus (`libs/test-data/src/data/2sa.usj.ts`), loaded into a
 * headless editor in Standard view (`editable` marker mode, matching how the real app displays
 * text a user can type into), an UNEDITED `$rebuildParas` request must refuse as a fixed point:
 * return `false`, and leave the editor -> USJ round trip byte-identical. A paragraph that fails
 * this is either a genuine rebuild regression (reported, not silently skipped) or a pre-existing
 * non-fixed-point the nesting arc already documents elsewhere (skip-listed below with the exact
 * mechanism named, not a task number).
 *
 * NOTE: the pre-generated `2sa.lexical.*.ts` fixture files (also under `libs/test-data/src/data`)
 * are stale — do not compare against them. This test builds editor state fresh from `usj2Sa` via
 * the same USJ->Lexical adaptor path `generate-2sa-lexical-states.test.ts` and
 * `tier2Rebuild.utils.test.tsx` use.
