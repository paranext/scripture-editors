/**
 * Typed char-attribute text must settle into real attribute state.
 *
 * The reported defect said undoing and moving off left attribute text on screen that never became
 * attribute state — the screen-vs-file divergence Invariant I forbids. That exact gesture is
 * already pinned (markerEditUndoResettle.test.tsx), but only with the marker-edit engine mounted
 * ALONE; the char attribute run is jointly owned by `CharNodePlugin`'s self-healing sync, and the
 * documented failure mode for this run kind is the two plugins interacting (see
 * charAttributeDeletionSettle.test.tsx). This suite covers the settle under the plugin stack the
 * app actually mounts, and across the shapes a user can type attributes into.
 *
 * Every assertion is checked against `usfmFragmentToUsjContent` — the tokenizer — rather than
 * against a hand-written expectation. Settle IS re-tokenization (Invariant I's corollary), so a
 * pin that hard-codes its own answer can drift away from the tokenizer without failing. That
 * matters most for the unclosed-span case, where NOT parsing the bytes as attributes is the
 * correct outcome and would otherwise look like the reported bug.
