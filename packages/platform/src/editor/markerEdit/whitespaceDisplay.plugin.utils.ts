/**
 * Standard-view whitespace display invariant and clipboard normalization — the LIVE-EDITING half

 * clipboard-event code). The pure string half — the load/serialize mapping and the full
 * architecture map of the feature — is `whitespaceDisplay.utils.ts` beside this file.
 *
 * While typing, spaces in a run are kept visible as display-NBSP (the same mapping
 * `usjTextToDisplay` applies at load time, applied incrementally as the user types); copying
 * or cutting selected text inverts display-NBSP back to plain spaces — wholesale for
 * `text/plain`, collapse-aware for `text/html` ({@link invertDisplayNbspInHtml}) — so pasted
 * text elsewhere isn't polluted with NBSP. Both pieces are gated to Standard view only by the
 * caller (`MarkerEditPlugin.tsx`) — they must not run in other view modes.

 * Standard-view PASTE normalization: a pasted data-NBSP must appear on screen as `~` (the

 * Without this, a pasted NBSP landed as a raw NBSP — indistinguishable from a display-NBSP
 * (which represents a plain space inside a run) — so nothing showed on screen live, and
 * serialization then corrupted it into a plain space; the `~` only appeared after an app
 * reload re-ran the load-time mapping. Internal pastes (application/x-lexical-editor payload)
 * are already in display form and pass through untouched. For the rare NBSP-bearing external
 * paste this inserts the normalized PLAIN text (foreign `text/html` formatting is dropped —
 * preserving the NBSP data beats preserving formatting the sanitizer would mostly strip
 * anyway). The same NBSP-bearing check also covers `text/html` (word-processor copies carry the
 * space as a literal `&nbsp;`): some sources omit `text/plain` entirely, or their browser-
 * generated `text/plain` has already collapsed `&nbsp;` to a plain space, losing the marker
 * before it ever reaches this handler — so `text/html`, and the pasted text it decodes to
 * (`htmlPasteText` above), are checked too, falling back to that decoded text when it's the
 * only place the NBSP survives.
 *
 * A MULTI-LINE payload is replayed line by line with an `INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND` dispatch
 * between lines, because no USFM line can carry a newline: inserting the whole payload at once
 * left literal `\n` bytes sitting inside a text node, a byte on screen the file cannot represent.
 * This claim runs at HIGH ahead of every other paste claim, so an NBSP-carrying paste never
 * reaches the multi-line claims that would otherwise split it — the split has to happen here.
 * Going through the COMMAND (rather than `selection.insertParagraph()`) is what makes a paste
 * into a character-style stack close and reopen that stack per line, the same way Enter does.
 * Line endings are already normalized by {@link getPastePayload}, so `\r\n` and bare-`\r`
 * clipboards break correctly and no `\r` ever lands in content. A single-line payload keeps the
 * exact one-`insertText` behavior it always had.

 * mapping in whitespaceDisplay.utils.ts), so shipping them to a rich-text paste target as real
 * NBSPs breaks line wrapping and text search there, while `text/plain` already inverts them all.
 * But a plain space does not always survive HTML: consumers collapse space runs and drop
 * fragment-edge whitespace. So this inversion keeps NBSP exactly where the plain space it stands
 * for would be destroyed:
 *
 * - a run of 2+ NBSPs stays all-NBSP — the form the display already carries (byte-stable; the
 *   conventional space/NBSP alternation would survive collapsing too, but changes bytes for no
 *   gain);
 * - a single NBSP at the very start or end of the fragment's text stays NBSP — HTML consumers
 *   drop a leading/trailing plain space, and edge whitespace is in the fragment only because the
 *   user deliberately selected it;
 * - every other single NBSP becomes the plain space it stands for.
 *
 * A genuine data NBSP takes no part here: Standard view displays it as a literal `~` (the USFM
 * byte form PT9 also shows and copies), so it is ordinary text to this inversion and ships as `~`
 * in BOTH flavors — the same display-vs-data line the `text/plain` inversion draws by replacing
 * only NBSP, never `~`. Either way both flavors decode to the same document text.
 *
 * Runs and edges are judged on the fragment's CONCATENATED text, not per markup span — a
 * marker-trailing NBSP separator and a paragraph-leading NBSP sit in different spans but form one
 * run a consumer would collapse if either became plain. The mapping is length-preserving, so the
 * result writes straight back to each text node as a slice.
