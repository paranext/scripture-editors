/** Serializable USJ locations relative to a specific USJ document (chapter or book) */
/**
 * A JSONPath query to a {@link MarkerContent}, {@link Usj}, or property within a USJ document and
 * additional information that point to a specific location in that USJ document.
 *
 * This type does not include a verse reference because the JSONPath is relative to a specific USJ
 * document; that USJ document may have a book, a chapter, or something else in it. Use
 * `UsjLocation` to specify which USJ document this location is relative to, making the
 * location an absolute verse reference location. The closest equivalent concept in USFM to this
 * relative document location is a string character index in a USFM document; such an index is
 * relative to a specific USFM document rather than indicating an absolute position in a Scripture
 * text.
 *
 * This type intends to represent USFM positions (`UsfmVerseLocation`) in USJ space. However,
 * there are some USFM positions that are not currently representable with these types:
 *
 * - The second slash in `optbreak`'s USFM representation `//` (literally not representable)
 * - Nested marker prefix on opening markers like `+` for character markers (literally not
 *   representable)
 * - The bar `|` that indicates the start of closing marker attributes (no official representation)
 * - The equals sign for closing marker attributes (no official representation)
 * - The quotes around closing marker attribute values (no official representation)
 * - The space between closing marker attributes (no official representation)
 *
 * Also note that the following types do not specify a concrete location that is actually in the USJ
 * document but represent a USFM location relative to the most similar thing in USJ that there is:
 *
 * - {@link UsjClosingMarkerLocation} - there are no distinct closing objects in JSON; there is a
 *   common syntax for closing every object, but it is only one character and is on every single
 *   object as opposed to USFM closing markers which are multiple characters long and are only
 *   sometimes present.
 * - {@link UsjAttributeKeyLocation} - when the attribute whose key is being pointed to is an
 *   attribute marker in USFM, the `keyOffset` does not apply to the USJ attribute name (e.g.
 *   `altnumber`) but to the USFM attribute marker name (e.g. `ca`).
 * - {@link UsjAttributeMarkerLocation} - attribute markers are just properties in JSON; they do not
 *   have their own object such that they would have an opening that can be pointed to in the JSON
 *   like they have their own opening in USFM.
 * - {@link UsjClosingAttributeMarkerLocation} - attribute markers are just properties in JSON, plus
 *   they are in the same situation as {@link UsjClosingMarkerLocation} as detailed above.
 *
 * To see many examples of the same point represented by both USFM and USJ locations, go to
 * https://github.com/paranext/paranext-core/tree/main/lib/platform-bible-utils/src/scripture/usj-reader-writer-test-data/testUSFM-2SA-1-locations.ts
